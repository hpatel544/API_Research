<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For my project, I have decided to incorporate a quotes API to provide<br>users with randomly generated quotes that they can add to their favorite list.<br>The specific API route I will be utilizing is <a href="https://quotes15.p.rapidapi.com/quotes/random/">https://quotes15.p.rapidapi.com/quotes/random/</a>. The main elements<br>I will be extracting from the API are the quote content and the<br>originator&#39;s name (referred to as the author name). By combining these two pieces<br>of information, I will display the quote alongside the respective author on my<br>website.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The Quotes By Martin Svoboda API is available for free usage without any<br>specific request limits within a 24-hour timeframe. The average latency for the API<br>is recorded at 665 ms. To access the API, proper authentication is required<br>by including the X-RapidAPI-Key and X-RapidAPI-Host headers in requests. These headers serve as<br>authentication credentials to ensure secure and authorized interaction with the API.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Being a student, I have never consumed an API. It will be my<br>first time doing it. Also, I have never created an API. I do<br>know how API works and What is an API. There are many other<br>alternatives as there are many APIs that generates random quotes for you.<br></p><br></td></tr>
